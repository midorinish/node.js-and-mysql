<h1> About Bamazon </h1>

Bamazon is an Amazon-like storefront app that was built using a mysql database, npm packages and javascript.

The app will take an order from a customer and maintain a total count of the store's supplies throughout all the purchases.

<h1>How to Use Bamazon</h1>

The app will first display a list of all of the available products, their costs and our current stock.

The app will asks the user the following items:

    1. The product ID
    2. The number of units the customer wishes to purchase

The app will display the stock before the purchase, what you are buying, how many units you are buying and the unit cost.

It will then display the total cost and ask if you would like to purchase another item.

When you begin, ensure that you run an npm install so that you have all the packages neccessary to run the application.
